The research is presenting a working software prototype'IMMERSIVE', an interactive design platform providing the architect/designer with a new perspectives for the design object, which enrich how the designers perceiving the design problem while walking through the designed space in a fully immersive environment. It also provides a collaborative three-dimensional environment for design and review between architects and different experts from other disciplines, this collaborative virtual environment enhance the communication and encourages co-operation, overcoming the barriers of space and time constraints. Through the use of virtual reality designers can explore a different layers of building information, which makes the design process more intuitive. A shared world of virtual reality offers a more sophisticated, interactive stimulating and engaging environment for architects and professionals alike- to communicate.
